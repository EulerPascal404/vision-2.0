Okay, I can help you navigate this room. To get to the other side, you'll need to move forward about 10 feet. You'll feel a chair on your right side, about 5 feet away, and then a couch to your left, also about 5 feet away.  Keep going forward and you'll run into a bed about 10 feet ahead.  You can then walk to the right side of the bed to continue on your journey.  There is another bed about 20 feet to your right.  You can continue forward and you'll reach the other side of the room.
