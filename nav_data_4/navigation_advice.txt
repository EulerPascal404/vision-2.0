Okay, to get to the other side of the room, you'll want to start by taking a few steps forward. You'll feel a chair to your right about 8.34 feet away. Keep walking forward, and you'll feel a chair to your left about 11.83 feet away.  Continue forward, and you'll encounter a dining table directly in front of you at a distance of 17.59 feet.  To get around the table, you can either turn right or left.  If you turn right, you'll encounter another chair to your right at a distance of 14.11 feet.  If you turn left, you'll encounter a chair to your left at a distance of 16.05 feet.  Once you've gone around the table, you'll be able to continue walking forward to the other side of the room.  Let me know if you have any questions.
