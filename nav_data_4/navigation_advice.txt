Okay, to get to the other side of the room, we're going to start by taking a few steps forward. You'll feel a chair on your right side about 8 and a half feet away. Keep going forward for about 10 more steps, and you'll encounter a table on your left. It's about 17 and a half feet away.  You'll need to take a slight turn to the left to avoid it.  After the table, you'll feel another chair on your right, about 16 feet away.  Keep walking straight for about 7 steps, and you'll be on the other side of the room.
